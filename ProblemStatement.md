You are Y21 undergrad @IITK wanting to get selected
in the Programming Club @IITK as a secretary. To do 
so PClub wants you to collect brownies but with a twist.

Consider the point (x, y) in the 2D plane such that x and y are integers and 0 ≤ x, y.
At that point some brownie packets are kept and
the number of brownie packets at that point equal 
to the sum, **x+y**. Now PClub draws a line
**y = (-x/m) + c**

You can only choose a rectangle such that sides of
rectangle are alligned with the axis and with all points
on or under the line drawn by PClub. You are allowed to 
take all brownies which are inside or on the sides
of that rectangle. The more brownies you pick the more
chances you have of getting selected.

Find the maximum number of brownies that you can collect.

### INPUT

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers m and c (1 ≤ m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000).


### OUTPUT

Print the maximum number of bananas Okabe can get from the trees he cuts.
